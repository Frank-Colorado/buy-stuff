# Buy Stuff Ecommerce App

## Description

This is an example ecommerce app I made using Stripe for payment processing. It is a full stack web application that uses React, Redux, Node.js, Express, GraphQL, and MongoDB. It is a simple ecommerce app that allows users to add items to their cart and purchase them using Stripe. It also has an admin page that allows the admin to add, edit, and delete items from the store.

## Usage

This video demonstrates the Admin page of the app which is not accessible to normal users. The admin page allows the admin to add, edit, and delete items from the store.

After creating the video I noticed there were a small visual bug from the screen capture software I was using that caused the filter dropdown selects on the admin page to not be visible while I was using them. This bug is not present when using the app normally and was purely a result of the screen capture software I was using.
